# C# Password Manager
This is a small project I did to get some practice with C#. I implemented symmetric encryption, AES, to encrypt/decrypt passwords and used the sha256 hash of a master password for encryption/decryption. The program can also generate a password for you which you can copy and past into a password file which will then be secured using your master password. That way you only have to remember one. <br>
